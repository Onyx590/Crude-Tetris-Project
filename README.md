# Crude-Tetris-Project
Here I have a very crude command line tetris game. It is made using Windows API.
The game design is done using ASCII characters. 

The game updates the user's high score as he plays

The thing that needs to be worked on here is that the window needs to be resizeable. Right now, if the window is resized, it distorts the entire game. I am working on a solution for this.
